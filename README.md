After cloning the repo, create an environment variable (.env file) both for the server(in the .env file create a MONGO_DB, PORT & JWT_KEY) and the client folder (in the .env file create a REACT_APP_PUBLIC_FOLDER & BASE_URL),
Open a terminal for the client and server folder, input/type "npm init" "npm Install" & "npm start" on both terminals to launch the app and view.
